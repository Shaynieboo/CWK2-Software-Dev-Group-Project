# CWK2-Software-Dev-Group-Project
Sky Project Implementation
For CWK2 we are doing the project implementation and it is recommended if not required to use GitHub. I believe it gains us extra points. I have created this repository for us to upload our committed codes and see feedback much easier and then record them on the Trello and the report. If you do not know how to use GitHub I suggest you learn XD ( I am still learning). I have made a list of what is required of us for this coursework and our respective roles down below:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Functionality Implementation (Individual)
You are expected to successfully implement a specific functionality within the group Django application.

Your functionality should:

Work correctly and integrate with the group project.

Demonstrate an understanding of backend and frontend development.

Follow best practices in Django (e.g. using models, views, forms, templates).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Testing
You must provide evidence of:

Testing your code (e.g. using Djangoâ€™s TestCase, manual testing screenshots, test coverage reports).

Clear demonstration of how bugs were identified and resolved.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Security Considerations
Identify potential security risks in your functionality.

Show how you addressed them (e.g. input validation, authentication checks).

Demonstrate awareness of data protection principles.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Use of UI/UX Principles
Show how your part of the app:

Implements clear and intuitive design.

Is accessible and user-friendly.

Follows visual consistency (Bootstrap, responsive layouts, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ 5. Use of Version Control
Demonstrate:

Frequent use of GitHub or other version control tools.

Descriptive commit messages.

Pull requests (PRs), branches, or evidence of code collaboration.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Reflection & Collaboration
Provide clear individual reflection on:

What you contributed to the project.

Challenges faced and how you overcame them.

Communication with team members (e.g. feedback given/received).

Response to client/mentor feedback.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Legal, Social, Ethical & Professional Issues
Identify relevant:

Legal concerns (e.g. GDPR, data retention).

Ethical issues (e.g. bias, fairness).

Professional issues (e.g. proper documentation, responsibilities).

ðŸ”¹ 8. Group Project Quality
As a group, the final project should:

Be fully working with connected components.

Show good use of database integration (models and relationships).

Include a video demo and CWK2 group submission template.

Use a shared project board (e.g. Trello or GitHub Projects) to manage progress.
